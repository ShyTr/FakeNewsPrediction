# Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is used for binary classification where we use sigmoid function, that takes input as independent variables and produces a probability value between 0 and 1.
For example, we have two classes Class 0 and Class 1 if the value of the logistic function for an input is greater than 0.5 (threshold value) then it belongs to Class 1 otherwise it belongs to Class 0. Itâ€™s referred to as regression because it is the extension of linear regression but is mainly used for classification problems.
